<h3>Python package "xlrd"</h3>


Purpose: Provide a library for developers to use to extract data
    from Microsoft Excel (tm) spreadsheet files.   
    It is not an end-user tool.

Author: John Machin, Lingfo Pty Ltd (sjmachin@lexicon.net)

Licence: BSD-style (see licences.py)

Version of xlrd: 0.6.0a3

Version of Python required: 2.1 or later.
    
External modules required:
    / The package itself is pure Python with no dependencies on modules or packages
    outside the standard Python distribution.
    / To run the demo script runxlrd.py with
    Python 2.2 or 2.1 requires the Optik module (version 1.4.1 or later) from 
    http://optik.sourceforge.net/
  
Versions of Excel supported:
    2004, 2002, XP, 2000, 97, 95, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0.
    2.x could be done readily enough if any demand.
    
Outside the current scope: xlrd will safely and reliably ignore any of these
if present in the file:
    * Anything to do with the on-screen presentation of the data (fonts, panes,
      column widths, row heights, ...)
    * Charts, Macros, Pictures, any other embedded object. WARNING: currently
      this includes embedded worksheets.
    * VBA modules
    * Formulas (results of formula calculations are extracted, of course).
    * Comments
    * Hyperlinks

Unlikely to be done:
    * Handling password-protected (encrypted) files.
    
Particular emphasis (refer docs for details):

    * Operability across OS, regions, platforms
      
    * Handling Excel's date problems, including the Windows / Macintosh
      four-year differential.
    
Quick start:
</p>
<pre><code>    import xlrd
    book = xlrd.open_workbook("myfile.xls")
    print "The number of worksheets is", book.nsheets
    print "Worksheet name(s):", book.sheet_names()
    sh = book.sheet_by_index(0)
    print sh.name, sh.nrows, sh.ncols
    print "Cell D30 is", sh.cell_value(rowx=29, colx=3)
    for rx in range(sh.nrows):
        print sh.row(rx)
    # Refer to docs for more details.
    # Feedback on API is welcomed.
</code></pre><p>

Another quick start: This will show the first, second and last rows of each
    sheet in each file:

<pre><code>    OS-prompt>python PYDIR/scripts/runxlrd.py 3rows *blah*.xls</code></pre>


Installation:

    * On Windows: use the installer.

    * Any OS: Starting with the .zip file, unzip into a suitable directory,
    chdir to that directory, then do "python setup.py install".

    * If PYDIR is your Python installation directory:
    the main files are in PYDIR/Lib/site-packages/xlrd
    (except for Python 2.1 where they will be in PYDIR/xlrd),
    the docs are in the doc subdirectory,
    and there's a sample script: PYDIR/Scripts/runxlrd.py
    
    * If os.sep != "/", make the appropriate adjustments.
