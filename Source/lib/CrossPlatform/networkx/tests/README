These files are for testing the methods and functions in NetworkX

The tests also demonstrate the usage of many of the features of NetworkX.

There are a few ways to run the tests.

The simplest way that will test most of the package is to
import networkx and run the test() function.

>>> import networkx
>>> networkx.test()

or::

   python -c "import networkx; networkx.test()

If you have the source package and the nose testing package you
can test the complete package with::

   python setup_egg.py nosetests

This requires the networkx-nose-plugin package which is
distributed in the networkx source.  


The python module benchmark.py can be used to compare relative speed of small
code bits using the timeit module for different graph classes.
